# Variables are used to save something in the computer's memory.
# PEP8: start variables with lowercase letters, you can use
# numbers and underscores _.
# The = sign is the assignment operator. It is used to
# assign a value to a name (variable).
# Usage: variable_name = expression
#full_name = 'Lucas Cosme'
#sum_two_plus_two = 2 + 2
#print(type(full_name))
#print(full_name, sum_two_plus_two)
