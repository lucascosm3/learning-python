# Boolean data type
# When asking a question in a program,
# there are only two possible answers:
# yes (True) or no (False).
# There are several operators for "asking questions".
# Among them is ==, which is a logical operator that
# asks if one value is equal to another.
print(10 == 10) # Yes => (True)
print(10 == 11) # No => (False)
print(type(10 > 11)) # type bool (boolean)
